Fully responsive and modern looking landingpage.


---

**Next13 Project** made as a practice project. There is only first page in the website and all other pages are JavaScript Mastery pages. I created only home page. In this project I learned why performance is crucial and how do faster apps and improve web performance. By this project I betterment my JS,TS and Tailwind skills. 

Also I have new knowledge about:
- FCP (First Content Paint),
- LCP (Largest Content Paint)
- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift).


## In project are used: 
- Reuseable components,
- Prefetchings,
- Responsive Web Design (RWD),
- Database with part of courses from JavaScript Mastery (where the buttons are redirecting),
- Next.js routing,


## Tools Used
1. JavaScript (Next.js 13)
2. TypeScript
3. Tailwind (Styles)
4. Sanity.io (Platform for structured content, used as database)
5. Vercel (Deployment)
6. VSCode (Code Editor)
